          I love to code, design, and weave together science and soul â€” crafting mindful digital
          experiences that inspire curiosity, creativity, and calm. Many of these creations emerged
          from my own journey â€” from rituals, reflections, and cross-cultural experiences that shaped
          my path â€” evolving into projects that nurture awareness, compassion, and collective harmony.

          My work blends art and logic â€” from developing in Next.js, Python, and Supabase to crafting
          interfaces in Tailwind, Figma, and Framer Motion. Iâ€™m endlessly fascinated by how design,
          data, and sound come together â€” much like music â€” to create rhythm, emotion, and flow in
          digital spaces.
