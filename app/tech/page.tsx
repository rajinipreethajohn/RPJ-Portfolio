          I love to code, design, and weave together science and soul — crafting mindful digital
          experiences that inspire curiosity, creativity, and calm. Many of these creations emerged
          from my own journey — from rituals, reflections, and cross-cultural experiences that shaped
          my path — evolving into projects that nurture awareness, compassion, and collective harmony.

          My work blends art and logic — from developing in Next.js, Python, and Supabase to crafting
          interfaces in Tailwind, Figma, and Framer Motion. I’m endlessly fascinated by how design,
          data, and sound come together — much like music — to create rhythm, emotion, and flow in
          digital spaces.
